# Deliverable 1
There are many Non-Profit organizations who are in need 
of some level of application Development support, but don't have the resources to hire or 
support their own staff of Software Engineers. Many of these companies use Pro-Bono opportunities 
as a means to solicit Software experts to accomplish their IT needs. The DevUp application bridges 
the gap between aspiring Developers looking for opportunities to level-up (or, DevUp) their skills, 
and companies offering Pro-Bono opportunities, and open source projects, which developers can use 
to improve their professional portfolios. These opportunities can serve as great experience and an 
opportunity for recent College and Bootcamp grads to solve real business problems while growing their
professional portfolios.
